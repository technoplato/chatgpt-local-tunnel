# User Story: Alex's Journey with GPT Coding Assistant

## Phase 1: Discovery and Onboarding

### Event: Discovery
- Alex hears about the GPT Coding Assistant via a tweet linking to its GitHub page. The tweet highlights its capabilities and ease of integration for automating coding tasks.

### Action: Initial Setup
- Intrigued, Alex visits the GitHub page where a well-documented README file guides them through the setup process. It explains how to download the Docker image and run it on their local

### System State: Initializing
- Alex follows the README instructions to pull the Docker image and starts the server. The Docker container includes the GPT Coding Assistant, pre-configured with all necessary dependencies.

### Action: Connection and Key Exchange
- Upon launching, the Docker application guides Alex through generating a secure connection. The system generates a private key and provides a simple web interface for Alex to drop the key into, automatically establishing a secure link between Alex's desktop and the GPT Coding Assistant.

### Feedback: Successful Setup Confirmation
- The system confirms a successful connection and displays a welcome message with a brief tutorial on how to start using the GPT Coding Assistant. The user interface is intuitive, allowing Alex to easily navigate and understand the features available.

## Phase 2: Project Integration and Goal Specification

### Event: Specifying the Project Goal
- Alex wants to add a new feature to their existing codebase: a notification system that alerts users via email under certain conditions.

### System State: Gathering Project Details
- Alex uses the interface to specify the path to their project directory. The GPT Coding Assistant automatically scans the files, detecting the project structure and current technologies used.

### Action: Communicating Requirements
- Through an interactive session, the GPT asks Alex detailed questions about the new feature, such as trigger conditions for the notifications and preferred email service providers. Alex provides answers, which the GPT records and begins to analyze.

## Phase 3: Development Assistance

### System State: Feature Planning and Code Suggestions
- Using the information provided by Alex, the GPT drafts a plan for the new feature, including necessary files and code changes. It offers a breakdown of tasks and generates initial code snippets.

### Event: Iterative Development
- Alex reviews the suggested code. They find a couple of optimizations and communicate these back to the GPT, which quickly updates the suggestions. This cycle continues, with GPT immediately adapting to feedback and refining the feature based on Alex's input.

### Action: Automated Testing and Refinement
- Once Alex is satisfied with the drafted code, the GPT automatically sets up unit tests and integration tests, running them to ensure everything works as expected. Alex watches as the system executes the tests, providing real-time feedback and logs.

## Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring

### System State: Pre-Deployment Checks
- Before deployment, the GPT performs a series of pre-deployment checks, ensures all dependencies are updated, and that the environment is ready for the new feature.

### Event: Deployment
- With everything in place, Alex initiates the deployment through the GPT interface. The system handles the process, integrating the new feature into the live environment without downtime.

### Action: Post-Deployment Monitoring
- After deployment, the G, PT sets up monitoring tools to track the performance of the new feature and ensure it operates correctly under various conditions.

## Phase 5: Completion and Review

### Feedback: Success Confirmation
- The GPT provides Alex with a detailed report of the deployment, including performance metrics and user feedback. Alex reviews the information and is pleased with the results.

### Event: Project Documentation
- Finally, the GPT automatically updates the project documentation to include the new feature and its configurations, ensuring that everything is well-documented and easy for any team member to understand.

### Closure: Satisfaction and Future Plans
- Alex is thrilled with the efficiency and ease of use of the GPT Coding Assistant. They plan to use it for future projects and share their positive experience with colleagues.
