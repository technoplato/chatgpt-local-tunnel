### Algorithm for Converting RealPatch Tool Patches to Special High-Level Patches

1. **Extract Unified Diff**: Start with the unified diff output from the `patch` tool.

2. **Remove Line Numbers**: 
   - Strip out line numbers between the `@@` symbols to focus on high-level changes without line-specific context.

3. **Identify High-Level Edits**:
   - Look for significant changes within the diff. Determine if the changes are substantial enough to warrant replacing entire code blocks (e.g., functions, methods, test cases).

4. **Modify Hunk Creation**:
   - Instead of including every single line change, modify the hunks to encompass entire code blocks. For example, if a few lines within a function are changed, replace the entire function.

5. **Anchor Changes**:
   - Anchor changes to logical points in the code, such as the beginning or end of the file, or specific sections like function definitions or test cases.
   - If a block of changes occurs at the end of a file,
     ensure the hunk includes removing the previous 
     end of the file as - and adds it back in the new 
     file with + in the hunk so we can properly 
     identify its intended position without line numbers.

6. **Maintain Consistency**:
   - Ensure that the patch maintains consistent formatting and indentation.
   - Verify that all changes are clean and do not introduce syntax errors.

7. **File Paths**:
   - Use relative file paths from the project root in the patch header.

8. **Special Cases**:
   - For file creations, ensure the patch shows a diff from `--- /dev/null` to `+++ path/to/new/file.ext`.
   - For file movements, create two hunks: one to delete from the old location and another to insert in the new location.

### Example Conversion Steps
diff -U0 example1/base/main.rs example1/changed/main.rs > example1/patches/U0/main.rs.patch
1. **Original Diff**:
