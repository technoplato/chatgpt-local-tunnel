### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **LLM**: Large Language Model
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- **RxJS**: Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript
- **Bun**: A modern JavaScript and TypeScript runtime
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js

## 2. Overall Description
### 2.1 Product Perspective
- The product uniquely integrates with the ChatGPT platform, offering capabilities not typically available in standalone OpenAI API implementations or local LLM setups. It utilizes a secure and efficient connection to a local server setup via Docker, enabling direct manipulation and queries against the user’s local files and systems.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Unique to this system is the integration of whisper dictation capabilities, allowing developers to dictate commands and code verbally to ChatGPT, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- Developers seeking advanced integration with GPT for real-time coding assistance directly in their local development environment.
- Teams looking for scalable solutions to integrate AI-driven coding assistance into their existing tech stacks seamlessly.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- The system is designed to operate within a Docker environment that runs on local machines, facilitating direct interaction with the user's local file systems and servers.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Requires continuous Internet connectivity to interact with the ChatGPT platform.
- Dependency on the Bun runtime for executing JavaScript and TypeScript, which must be managed within the Docker container.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Setup and Initialization
#### 3.1.1 System Setup
- Users shall initiate the system by running a Docker container which includes all necessary dependencies pre-configured, ensuring a quick setup and integration process.

#### 3.1.2 Secure Connection and Accessibility
- The system shall provide secure connectivity protocols to establish a safe communication link between the local environment and the ChatGPT platform.
- Incorporate whisper dictation technology, allowing users to communicate with the system using voice commands, thereby enhancing the user interface and accessibility.

### 3.2 Development Process Automation
#### 3.2.1 Interactive Development Interface
- Implement an interface within the local server that can interpret and execute commands from ChatGPT based on user input and whisper dictation, dynamically interacting with the local development environment.

#### 3.2.2 Real-Time Code Manipulation
- Enable the system to perform real-time code generation, modification, and execution within the user’s local environment, facilitating immediate feedback and iterative development.

### 3.3 Testing and Deployment
#### 3.3.1 Automated Testing with Feedback Loops
- Utilize RxJS to manage asynchronous data flows from test executions to the GPT model, allowing for real-time adjustments and improvements based on test outcomes.

#### 3.3.2 Documentation and Continuous Integration
- Ensure that each coding session updates the project documentation in real-time, reflecting changes and additions made during the session.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment processes, leveraging the system's ability to directly interact with local development tools and environments.
